This notebook is to model temperature change over time. 

This is a Markov Model where changes in state have a normal distribution inspired by actual temperature variability data about a mean that changes at about the same proportional rate as carbon dioxide has been rising in recent decades.

```{r}
nyears <- 10 # number of years to be simulated
mgt <- 25 # mean global temperature
states <- matrix(1, nrow = 12, ncol = nyears)
lintime <- matrix()
for (j in 1:nyears) {
  for (i in 1:12) {
    states[i,j] <- (mgt + rnorm(1, j/165, 0.1))
    mgt <- states[1,j]
  }
}
for (i in 2:nyears) {
  lintime <- cbind(c(lintime[,1],states[,i]))
}
lintime <- matrix(lintime)
plot(lintime, type = "l")
```

We construct a linear model of our data.

```{r}
summary(lm(lintime ~ c(1:109)))
```
